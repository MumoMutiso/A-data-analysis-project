In this project, I delved into the investment landscape of Indian startups spanning from 2018 to 2021. The objective was to equip both my hypothetical team and potential investors contemplating entry into the Indian startup ecosystem with comprehensive insights, enabling them to make well-informed decisions. 

Throughout the analysis, I utilized VScode and Jupyter notebook as my primary tools.

Hypothesis

***Null Hypothesis(Ho)***: There is no siginificate difference in the amount of funding between startups in Bangalore.

***Alternative Hypothesis(Ha)***: There is a siginificant difference in the amount of funding between startups in Banaglore.

In line with the above, several questions were asked and some findings made accordingly.

Based on my analysis, it's clear that the **Technology** sector has been a standout performer in terms of funding trends from 2018 to 2021. This sector, along with related tech-incorporated sectors like Commerce, Transport and Finance, presents promising opportunities for investors and entrepreneurs. Additionally, Bangalore and Mumbai, being prominent hubs for startups and investments, offer valuable networking prospects. Therefore, exploring opportunities in tech-driven sectors and engaging with Mumbai's startup ecosystem could lead to favourable outcomes in terms of growth and innovation.
